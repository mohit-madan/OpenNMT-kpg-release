"The more I look at it, the more I want it! The color looks super sleek and sophisticated, and I love the ridges. The pop of lime in the green seems to be something that some will like and others won't. I could definitely see why people would like it, but for me, I feel that the pop of lime green kind of throws of the overall sophisticated and edgy mood of the card."
yes
Its ok
is there a difference?
its green
doesn't say any thing.  It is plain
