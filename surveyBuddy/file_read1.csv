"Westworld literally plays you. It plays you as assuredly as the skeletal fingers that dance across the piano keys in the title sequence. Each episode draws you in and seduces you with the promise of revelations, before flipping those expectations on their head and delivering something more interesting and finely crafted than you’d thought possible. Not only that, though, Westworld’s episodes subtly seed persistent narrative elements that coalesce when the show is ready to reveal its secrets to the viewer."

It's an aspect that every feeling, thinking human being longs for and apparently so do robots when they're created by humans who understand that. Westworld, for me is the complete understanding that if you create it and then break it, you have to fix it or make it better.

It is a show that challenges, that surprises, that stimulates. Thandie Newton, Ed Harris and Jeffrey Wright are revelations. Evan Rachel Wood continues to be tremendous. The visual effects are cinematic. So is the production design and cinematography. Virtually everything is first-rate.

"The best sci-fi show of all time and offers deeper thought than a philosophy or religious course. This show is utterly beautiful while also gritty, and even eerie at times. This show is a microcosm that represents what humans are capable of. Unpredictable, the script is intelligently written and pieced together. The filming is memorizing in cinematographic appeal. Among the many themes throughout Westworld, the nature of reality and the nature of humanity are at it's core. This show's plot, the logistical details of the AI, and the universe they exist in are well thought out and blend together nicely. Every character has a backstory and motives in such a way that builds interesting character depth. It is fun to see how characters adapt to the world as they learn. While multiple plot lines are intertwined, raw action and twists constantly occur in this crazy universe that is constantly on the verge of catastrophe. This show addresses questions such as: What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to exist? What is my purpose? This is explored and searched for by the main characters. While these are introspective questions that can be explored internally; parallel to this musing, their search is embedded in the reality they find themselves in externally. Moreover, it is represented by the mysterious prodding and puzzles intrinsic to the immediate world in which they exist. The sci-fi elements of the show touch on advanced AI, multiple realities, self awareness, machine learning, big data, and big tech privacy. This show is spot on by metaphorically addressing these concepts. These issues are becoming more relevant by the day in our lives by shaping the future of human society. Without a doubt, sci-fi has never been done better, making movies such as the Matrix fall to the feet of Westworld and it's unprecedented splendor."

"Westworld is innovative, thought-provoking, and intriguing. It is a fantastic dystopia that examines the cross-section of humanity and technology. I love it! I particularly love shows like Westworld that are about sci-fi dystopias and question the right and wrong of technology and the future. Even though they are fantasies at this time, you can't help feel that they may prophesize something about the future. Additionally, the way the show was set up and written was extremely clever and engaging, from the first season's theme park introduction to the new season's step into the real world. Content like this is not frequent and it definitely makes this show a must-watch for a lot of people including me."

"The exploration of the parks and characters are extremely interested in the idea that someone could continuously go into the parks or continue in the parks and those characters escaping is thrilling. I was a big fan of the original movie and novel, but bringing the show Into the modern era has made it extremely interesting. I am not caught up on all of the episodes but I do intend to watch due to the acting riveting story lines and interesting nature of character development. The emotional attachment I have to some of the characters is greater than other shows in the genre. I am not a huge fan of Aaron Paul on the show. It seems a little odd to have him on the show due to his involvement in a show with similar dark storylines and themes."
