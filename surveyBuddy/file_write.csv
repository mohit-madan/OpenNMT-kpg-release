"The best sci-fi show of all time and offers deeper thought than a philosophy or religious course. This show is utterly beautiful while also gritty, and even eerie at times. This show is a microcosm that represents what humans are capable of. Unpredictable, the script is intelligently written and pieced together. The filming is memorizing in cinematographic appeal. Among the many themes throughout Westworld, the nature of reality and the nature of humanity are at it's core. This show's plot, the logistical details of the AI, and the universe they exist in are well thought out and blend together nicely. Every character has a backstory and motives in such a way that builds interesting character depth. It is fun to see how characters adapt to the world as they learn. While multiple plot lines are intertwined, raw action and twists constantly occur in this crazy universe that is constantly on the verge of catastrophe. This show addresses questions such as: What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to exist? What is my purpose? This is explored and searched for by the main characters. While these are introspective questions that can be explored internally; parallel to this musing, their search is embedded in the reality they find themselves in externally. Moreover, it is represented by the mysterious prodding and puzzles intrinsic to the immediate world in which they exist. The sci-fi elements of the show touch on advanced AI, multiple realities, self awareness, machine learning, big data, and big tech privacy. This show is spot on by metaphorically addressing these concepts. These issues are becoming more relevant by the day in our lives by shaping the future of human society. Without a doubt, sci-fi has never been done better, making movies such as the Matrix fall to the feet of Westworld and it's unprecedented splendor.",offers deeper thought/religious course/offers deeper/show/best sci,interesting character depth/big tech/questions such/multiple plot/fi show,"Good/like the show/everything,Thought provoking,Like the writing/dialog,Looks realistic,Technological aspects (inclusion of robots, exploring AI, etc.),Witty/humorous/funny/entertaining,Appealing characters/I like the characters"
